<html><head></head><body><p>In this exercise you will implement a working interpreter for a non-trivial subset of the logic programming language
Prolog. Knowledge of Prolog or predicate logic is not required, although knowing both or either makes it easier
to understand how the interpreter works. The general program structure is provided in the form of header files.
Relatively detailed descriptions of the key algorithms (unification and the evaluation) and some sample Prolog
programs are also included.
</p>

<h2>A very short introduction to Prolog</h2>
<p>
Prolog is a logic programming language which is based on first-order predicate logic. Predicate logic is Turing-complete
and Prolog restricts it's operations to Horn clauses which form a Turing-complete subset of predicate logic. For this
exercise understanding predicate logic or Horn clauses is not necessary. It is sufficient to know that they are logical
clauses of form name(arguments) :- body. and that the clause is true if all clauses in it's body are true. 
</p>
<p>
Given a program (a database) and a query (goal), the prolog interpreter must answer the question "Does the goal logically
follow from the program?". Valid answers are either yes or no, in the case of the affirmative, the solution
must also be presented (free variables within the solution unified to their proper values). In the most simple case
the program can consist of a single atom like "happy.", given the query "happy." the interpreter simply replies 'yes'
because the query does logically follow from the database, however, given the query "unhappy." the interpreter would
reply 'no'. In the most complicated case an exhaustive search has to be performed to determine if the query can be
deduced from the logical rules of the program. Some queries can have more than one correct reply, some even have an
infinite amount of correct replies.
</p>

<h2>Data structures within the interpreter</h2>

<p>Variables. A variable is a sequence of alpha-numeric characters that begins with a capital letter (A..Z).</p>

<p>Compound terms. A compound term is of form name(arguments) :- body. Where the name is an alpha-numeric string
that does not beging with a capital letter (A..Z). A term need not have a body or even arguments. In a case when the
term has no arguments it's called an atom, for example in the term age(joe, 20)., terms "joe" and "20" are atoms.</p>

<h2>How to implement the interpreter</h2>
<p>Following is the recommended order in which the interpreter should be implemented. The functions declared in the
header file plterm.h can be implemented gradually over the exercise, when their functionality becomes necessary.
Test your implementation with the three given Prolog programs, the programs in order of increasing complexity are:
facts.pl, sum.pl and ackermann.pl. See the comments in the programs for sample input/output.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Tokeniser. Since the tokeniser does not depend on any other part of the interpreter it can be implemented and tested
without any other part of the interpreter ready and should therefore be the first part of the interpreter you implement.</li>
<li>Parser. Requires the tokeniser but no other parts of the interpreter, the function PLTermPrint() is useful for debugging
the parser.</li>
<li>Unification. See the unification.txt file for a description of the unification algorithm and some examples of unifying
and non-unifying terms. You should be absolutely certain that your implementation of the unification algorithm is flawless
before you start implementing the evaluator.</li>
<li>Evaluator. The evaluator is, with the unification algorithm, the core of the interpreter. Use the sample prolog programs
to test and debug your evaluator.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This implementation of the interpreter is minimal but can easily be extended to provide most of the features available
in actual Prolog interpreters. Several of Prolog's features would be easily implemented, such as cut, integer arithmetics
or built in predicates for list handling and meta logical operations.
</p>

<h2>User interface</h2>
<p>The interpreter uses a minimal user interface that allows interaction with the interpreter. The interface is
simple to implement as all input is assumed valid (unrealistic with a human user). The only special input is
the fact quit. which causes the interpreter to terminate and free all memory allocated dynamically.</p>

<p>Here are the user interface messages apart from PLTermPrint()
</p><pre>printf("Query:\n");
printf("No.\n");
printf("Solution: ");
printf("More solutions (y/n) ?\n");
</pre><p></p>

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<ul>
<li>You can assume that all input is syntactically valid.</li>
<li>Your implementation need not handle stack overflow, the interpreter will only be tested with programs
for which there is a solution in finite time and space or no solution at all.</li>
<li>You should test each part of the interpreter with valgrind.</li>
<li>You are allowed to have one global variable for the purpose of renaming variables in terms.</li>
<li>Read the database to the same order as it is in the file. That is, with database number(1). number(2). The first reply of
the query number(N). Must be number(1).</li>
<li>This exercise is not impossible but does require a strong knowledge of C.</li>
<li>The model solution is roughly 750 lines in total, including the main() function.</li>
<li>You can assume that the name of a term or a variable does not exceed 128 characters in length</li> 
<li>Memory leaks of any kind are not appreciated.</li>
</ul>
